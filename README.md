# CryptoFeed

A minimally curated daily feed of websites related to blockchain and cryptocurrencies.
Useful for discovering unsafe and potentially dangerous websites (scams, phishing, fraud). 
Since blockchain financial products and cryptocurrencies are not currently regulated, netizens must rely on their own judgement and personal experience to avoid crypto fraud.
This project aims to improve netizens awareness and help them avoid becoming victims of crypto fraud by providing daily feeds of new and unsafe crypto websites.
